## What Happened

These documents were created during the analysis and planning phase of migrating from the legacy flat structure to the numbered folder structure.

**Timeline:**
1. **2025-10-05:** Numbered structure introduced, documentation written
2. **2025-10-05:** Legacy code moved to `_legacy_data_sources/`
3. **2025-10-06:** Analysis revealed documentation-reality gap
4. **2025-10-06:** Created comprehensive migration plan
5. **2025-10-06:** Consolidated scattered docs into single guide

## Archived Files

### 1. REPOSITORY_ORGANIZATION_ANALYSIS.md

**Purpose:** Identified mismatch between documented structure and actual codebase

**Key findings:**
- Documentation described numbered folders (`01_`, `02_`, etc.)
- Code still used old paths (`hurdat2/`, `census/`, etc.)
- `_legacy_data_sources/` marked "legacy" but actively used
- 161 references to legacy paths found

**Outcome:** Led to creation of MIGRATION_PLAN.md

### 2. DOCUMENTATION_REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

**Purpose:** Original plan for reorganizing documentation

**Recommendations:**
- Consolidate scattered READMEs
- Create single source of truth
- Reduce duplication

**Outcome:** Superseded by REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md consolidation

### 3. DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY_ASSESSMENT.md

**Purpose:** Evaluated whether numbered folder design was sound

**Conclusion:** âœ… Design is excellent (9/10), implementation incomplete (4/10)

**Key insight:** "The design philosophy is sound. The execution is half-done."

**Outcome:** Confirmed numbered structure worth completing, not abandoning

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

**Reasons to preserve:**
1. Shows thought process behind migration
2. Documents what was analyzed
3. Provides context for future decisions
4. Historical record of repository evolution

**These files are not meant to be read regularly** - they're historical artifacts.

## If You're Reading This

**You probably want:**
- **Current structure:** See `00_documentation/REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md`
- **Migration plan:** See `00_plans/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Quick reference:** See `00_documentation/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`

**You probably DON'T need these archived files unless:**
- Researching why numbered structure was chosen
- Understanding migration decision process
- Writing retrospective on project evolution
