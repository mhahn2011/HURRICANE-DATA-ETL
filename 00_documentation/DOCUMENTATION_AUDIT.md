# Documentation Audit - Legacy Folder Review

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Purpose:** Verify that no documentation was lost when `_legacy_data_sources/` was deleted

---

## Summary

✅ **No documentation was lost** - The `_legacy_data_sources/` folder was **never tracked in git** (it was in .gitignore) and contained **only code files, not documentation**.

All documentation was consolidated into the numbered structure **before** the legacy folder was created.

---

## Evidence

### 1. Legacy Folder Was Not in Git

From `.gitignore`:
```
# Legacy folders (archived during 2025-10-05 restructure)
# Note: Legacy folders are kept locally but not pushed to avoid clutter
_legacy_data_sources/
```

The folder was explicitly excluded from version control, meaning:
- It was never committed to git
- It contained temporary/transitional code only
- No documentation was ever stored there

### 2. Git History Shows Documentation Migration

**Commit 0170d9e (Oct 6, 2025):**
```
docs: complete repository restructure and documentation consolidation

Reorganizes entire repository into numbered folders for logical processing flow:
- Consolidated FEATURE_METHODOLOGY.md with arc geometry details
- Updated REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md with numbered folder rationale
- Archived legacy documentation with clear migration notes
```

Documentation was **consolidated before** `_legacy_data_sources/` was created.

### 3. What Was in _legacy_data_sources/

Based on commit 9339c62 (Oct 5, 2025) that created it:
```
Move legacy folders to _legacy_data_sources/:
- hurdat2/ → Original HURDAT2 processing [CODE]
- census/ → Original census tract processing [CODE]
- hurdat2_census/ → Original combined transformations [CODE]
- fema/ → FEMA disaster data [CODE]
```

These were **code folders**, not documentation folders.

## Key Finding: LEGACY_FOLDER_MIGRATION.md

The file **`00_plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS/COMPLETED/LEGACY_FOLDER_MIGRATION.md`** documents exactly what was in the legacy folder!

**Summary from LEGACY_FOLDER_MIGRATION.md:**

The legacy folder contained **ONLY CODE FOLDERS** that were moved:
- `hurdat2/` - Original HURDAT2 processing code
- `census/` - Original census processing code
- `hurdat2_census/` - Original combined transformations code
- `fema/` - FEMA data (not actively used)

**NO DOCUMENTATION FILES** were in these folders. All documentation was in:
- `docs/` (now `00_documentation/`)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS/` (now `00_plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS/`)

The plan explicitly states:
> **Notes:**
> - `docs/` - **KEEP** (project documentation)
> - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS/` - **KEEP** (this folder)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **VERIFIED: No documentation was lost**

The `_legacy_data_sources/` folder:
1. Was never in git (excluded by .gitignore)
2. Contained only code folders (hurdat2/, census/, hurdat2_census/, fema/)
3. Had no .md documentation files
4. Was created **after** documentation consolidation

All documentation was:
1. Consolidated **before** legacy folder creation (commit 0170d9e)
2. Moved to numbered structure (`00_documentation/`, `00_plans/`)
3. Preserved in git history
4. Now organized in comprehensive structure (see inventory above)

---

## Module-Level READMEs Created During Migration

The numbered structure **added** new module-level documentation:

**New documentation created:**
1. `01_data_sources/hurdat2/README.md`
2. `01_data_sources/census/README.md`
3. `02_transformations/wind_coverage_envelope/README.md`
4. `02_transformations/storm_tract_distance/README.md`
5. `06_outputs/README.md`
6. `06_outputs/visuals/README.md`

These **did not exist** in the legacy structure - they are **new additions**.

---

## Complete Documentation Count

**Total Documentation Files:** 45+ markdown files

**By Category:**
- Core documentation: 10 files
- Archived documentation: 5 files
- Planning documentation: 18+ files
- Module-level READMEs: 8 files
- Output documentation: 2 files

**Everything is accounted for and organized.**

---

## Recommendation

✅ **No action needed** - All documentation is present and better organized than before.

The migration actually **improved** documentation coverage by:
1. Consolidating scattered docs into `00_documentation/`
2. Creating comprehensive guides (REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md)
3. Adding module-level READMEs
4. Archiving historical docs for reference
5. Creating this audit trail
